## SPACE-R react

The goal of the project is to design a simple web-page using our newfound knowledge gained during last week's react project. THis is the first teamwork project in the advanced java branch.

There are no real UI restrictions on the project and it must be designed using React and a selected public API should be used as the content's source.

Requirements:

- Use React Hooks and Function Components
- Use axios, react-router-dom, styled-components, Context API
- Use a public API to populate the page's content
